# Survey Length Calculator

This is a simple calculator that can be used to estimate the length of time taken to complete a survey based on the types of questions and instructions included in the survey. This is my first project building a Shiny app (using shiny for python), and exporting it into a shinylive environment. The calculations themselves are generally based upon the method of estimating survey length developed by [Versta Research](https://verstaresearch.com/newsletters/how-to-estimate-the-length-of-a-survey/). Which allocates points based on question complexity. However the original methodology does not provide advice for spatial response questions that may occur frequently in planning and engineering project. Each of question or response expected of this type is estimated to take about 30 seconds in the current methodology.
